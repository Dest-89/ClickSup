1. **Mitochondrial Support** - PQQ supports brain cell energy production
2. **Memory Enhancement** - Bacopa Monnieri traditionally used for memory support
3. **Neurotransmitter Support** - Alpha GPC supports acetylcholine production
4. **Neuroprotection** - Antioxidant compounds help protect brain cells
