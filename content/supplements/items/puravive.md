## About Puravive

Puravive is formulated to target brown adipose tissue (BAT), a type of body fat that burns calories to generate heat. Research suggests that increasing BAT activity may support healthy weight management.

## How It Works

The proprietary blend works through multiple mechanisms:

1. **BAT Activation** - Supports the activity of calorie-burning brown fat
2. **Metabolic Support** - Contains 8 exotic nutrients studied for metabolic benefits
3. **Cellular Energy** - Promotes healthy energy production at the cellular level

## Who Should Use Puravive

Puravive is designed for:
- Adults seeking natural weight management support
- Those interested in metabolic health
- People looking for plant-based supplement options
- Anyone wanting to support healthy body composition

## Recommended Usage

Take one capsule daily with a glass of water. Consistent use for 3-6 months is recommended for optimal results.
