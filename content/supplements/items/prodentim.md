## About ProDentim

ProDentim is a unique oral probiotic supplement designed to support the health of your teeth and gums. Unlike traditional dental products, ProDentim repopulates the mouth with beneficial bacteria to support a healthy oral microbiome.

## How It Works

The formula supports oral health through probiotic action:

1. **Oral Microbiome Support** - Beneficial bacteria support a healthy mouth environment
2. **Gum Health** - Specific strains studied for gum tissue support
3. **Tooth Support** - Nutrients support overall dental health
4. **Fresh Breath** - Healthy bacteria help maintain fresh breath naturally

## Who Should Use ProDentim

ProDentim is ideal for:
- Anyone wanting to support oral health naturally
- Those concerned about gum health
- People seeking probiotic benefits for the mouth
- Anyone wanting fresher breath

## Recommended Usage

Chew one tablet daily, preferably in the morning after brushing. Allow tablet to dissolve fully in mouth for best results.
