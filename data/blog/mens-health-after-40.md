Turning 40 marks a significant milestone in a man's health journey. Understanding the changes your body undergoes and how to support it is key to thriving in this chapter.

## Key Health Priorities

### 1. Prostate Health
The prostate gland grows with age. Support it with:

### 2. Heart Health
Cardiovascular disease risk increases significantly. Focus on:

Sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) accelerates. Combat it with:
- Resistance training
- Adequate protein (1g per pound)
