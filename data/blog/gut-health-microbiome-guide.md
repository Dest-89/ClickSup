# Gut Health 101: Understanding Your Microbiome

Your gut contains trillions of bacteria that influence far more than digestion. Welcome to the fascinating world of the microbiome.

## What is the Microbiome?

Your gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of:
- 100 trillion bacteria
- 1,000+ different species
- 3-5 pounds of microbial mass
- More genes than your human genome

## The Gut-Body Connection

### Immune System
70-80% of your immune cells reside in the gut. A healthy microbiome trains your immune system to distinguish friend from foe.

### Brain Health
The "gut-brain axis" connects your digestive system directly to your brain via the vagus nerve. Gut bacteria produce:
- 90% of your serotonin
- 50% of your dopamine

### Weight Management
Certain bacteria species are associated with:
- Better metabolic health
- Improved insulin sensitivity
- Reduced inflammation

## Signs of Poor Gut Health

- Digestive issues (bloating, gas, irregularity)
- Food intolerances
- Frequent illness
- Fatigue
- Skin problems
- Mood imbalances

## Supporting Your Microbiome

### Probiotics
Live beneficial bacteria found in:
- Fermented foods (yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi)
- Supplements (look for multiple strains, CFU count)

### Prebiotics
Fiber that feeds good bacteria:
- Onions, garlic, leeks
- Bananas, asparagus
- Oats, flaxseed

### Lifestyle Factors
- Reduce processed foods
- Manage stress
- Get adequate sleep
- Limit unnecessary antibiotics

## Choosing a Probiotic

Look for:
- Multiple strains (Lactobacillus + Bifidobacterium)
- At least 10 billion CFU
- Survivability guarantee
- Third-party testing

Your gut health is foundational to overall wellness. Small changes can yield significant improvements.
